# Getting started with cryptography
Modern cryptography is used by phones and computers to keep all of our digital information secret, safe and secure.  It's used everywhere, but most people don't know how it works or even what it does.

The funny thing is, the core algorithms underlying modern cryptography are built using  arithmatic and algebraic concepts that most middle-schoolers would be familiar with.  This website aims to teach the basic concepts of modern cryptography with that in mind.  After learning everything presented here, middle-school students should be able to hide and share secret messages using math that they already understand.
# What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information to keep it secure from unauthorized access. Throughout history, it has played a crucial role in military and diplomatic communications, evolving from simple substitution ciphers used in ancient times to complex algorithms that protect our digital world today. Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and Romans, employed cryptography to send secret messages during wars and political negotiations. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, more sophisticated methods were developed as the need for secure communication grew.

The advent of computers and the internet in the 20th century transformed cryptography, leading to the development of modern cryptography. This era introduced computational algorithms that leverage mathematical theories to secure data, enabling everything from secure online transactions to private communications over the internet.

Modern cryptography gives us a set of mathematical tools that people can use to communicate without anyone else knowing what they're saying. Imagine you wrote a note that said, "Let's meet at the park at 4 PM," but you didn't want anyone else to know about it. With modern cryptography, you can scramble your message into something that looks like gobbledygook to anyone who finds itâ€”unless they know the secret that allows them to decrypt the message.  Modern cryptography also gives us tools that help us confirm that the person sending the message is who we think they are, so we can avoid getting tricked.
