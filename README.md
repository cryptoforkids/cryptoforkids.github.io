# Getting started with cryptography
Modern cryptography is used by phones and computers to keep all of our digital information secret, safe and secure.  It's used everywhere, but most people don't know how it works or even what it does.

The funny thing is, the core algorithms underlying modern cryptography are built using  arithmatic and algebraic concepts that most middle-schoolers would be familiar with.  This website aims to teach the basic concepts of modern cryptography with that in mind.  After learning everything presented here, middle-school students should be able to hide and share secret messages using math that they already understand.
